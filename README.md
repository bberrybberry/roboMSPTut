# MSP430 Tutorials with Energia

Designed by Breanna Higgins. To be used for tutorials within the Robotics and Automation Society at Rowan University

---

## Purpose

These tutorials are designed as in introduction to embedded systems using the TI launchpads for their MSP430 line of microprocessors. These tutorials are aimed at students with no prior experience with microcontrollers and some experience with basic programming. These tutorials will strengthen skills in programming and robotics design.

# LESSON PLAN

## 1. Basics of C and the Energia Library: The Blink

This tutorial outlines the basic usage of Energia for programming the MSP430. A small overview of basic programming topics will be covered. Focus will be on using the Energia library to interact with the microcontroller. The student will walk away with an understanding of simple LED blinking code.

## 2. General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) and Interrupts: The Blink Improves

This tutorial looks at the pin functions on the pinout of the MSP430G2553. Usage will cover onboard LEDs and buttons. A discussion will include polling vs interrupts. The LED will be controlled by user input on the board.

## 3. What is time: The Blink, Upgraded

This tutorial will focus on timed applications and pulse width modulation (PWM) signals. Usage will show how to measure timed events with the internal timers. Analog outputs will be used to show PWM signals. The LED will be set to different brightness levels based on user input on the buttons.

## 4. Analog Inputs: You Control the Blink

This tutorial will explain analog readings and look at sensor applications. IR reflectance sensors will be used to detect robot boundaries. Usage of IR and Sonar sensors will be displayed as well.

## 5. Motors

This tutorial will combine previous skills to show the use of external hardware such as the Toshiba TB6612FNG dual DC motor controller. Emphasis will be on the construction of simple robots. End goal should be a basic line-following robot.
